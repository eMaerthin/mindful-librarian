# mindful-librarian
This is a fun project that has been inspired by the [unaweza](https://www.unaweza.org/) idea for the hackathon [hack for the rescue 2023](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ks9pIIJOhPeMvi25SmeTZC05b7vhSE2u/view)

The project is a web app written in python that is consuming openai API and mongo for data storage. More details available [here](https://challengerocket.com/hack-to-the-rescue/works/mindful-librarian-a24ecb)

## Storage
We use mongo server.

## Deployment
We design a docker image to deploy the app in the repeatable environment.

## Features
We (plan to) use chatgpt and dalle from openai to generate content in a creative way.
